Polymer.dart

Basic questions (no events, no update propagations)

- how to pass an argument to a polymer-element?
- how to pass a list to a polymer-element?
- must we use a template to pass an argument to a polymer-element?
- must we use the bind attribute to pass an argument to a polymer-element?

- what does @published means?
- what does @observable mean?
- what is the difference between @published and @observable?

Now any variable that is flagged with the @published annotation automatically becomes observable 
and it is accessible as an attribute on your custom element’s tag.

You can place <template> elements on the main HTML page, but they will not be bound to the main library’s scope. 
Polymer.dart does not support binding to a library scope, but you can instantiate a template by setting the model to a Dart object.

@published should be used only in a web component (polymer-element)
