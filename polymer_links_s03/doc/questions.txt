Polymer.dart

Basic questions (no events, no update propagations)

- how to pass an argument to a polymer-element?
  + from a main page that is not component: polymer_links_s02
  + from one component to another component: polymer_links_s03
- how to pass a list to a polymer-element? as any other argument
- must we use a template to pass an argument to a polymer-element? yes
- must we use the bind attribute to pass an argument to a polymer-element? no

- what does @published means? an attribute of the component' tag
- what does @observable mean? changes will be observed and reported to ?
- what is the difference between @published and @observable?

Now any variable that is flagged with the @published annotation automatically becomes observable 
and it is accessible as an attribute on your custom element’s tag.
@published should be used only in a web component (polymer-element)

You can place <template> elements on the main HTML page, but they will not be bound to the main library’s scope. 
Polymer.dart does not support binding to a library scope, but you can instantiate a template by setting the model to a Dart object.
